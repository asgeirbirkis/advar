# advar
The advar class is used to demonstrate how automatic linearity detection
can be incorporated into standard forward mode, operator overloaded 
implementation of automatic differentiation (AD).

As such, it is not meant to be an exhaustive software package; rather, it
includes overloaded Matlab methods for the binary operators +,-,/,* and ^,
as well as few selected methods such as cos, sin, and exp.
